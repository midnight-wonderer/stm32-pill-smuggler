# STM32 Pill Smuggler

## What is it?

STM32 Pill Smuggler is a friendly build system with sane defaults for [Blue Pill](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=stm32+blue+pill).  
(But, if you feel like it, feel free to add other pills and send me a pull request.)

## Why?

Yet another `make`-based build system was born. There is no end to it, but this is one of the sanest in the class (I promised) with bare minimum configuration experiences and opinionated decisions taken.
